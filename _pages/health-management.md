## Making sense of the Covid-19 pandemic

Dr Jacques Bughin, UN consultant, Solvay Business School ULB, Portulans Institute and G20Y, former Director McKinsey Global Institute, and senior partner McKinsey & Company.

*Note: this series of articles is a compilation of multiple reflective investigations I made regarding the Covid-19 as it evolves through times, since March 2020. By design, this has been work-in-progress, with inevitable shortcomings, errors of mine, but with a purpose of “80-20”, with a view to share possibly important insights as long as the crisis evolves. I am grateful to a long list of people who provided feedbacks as well encouragements along the way. I hope that some of the ideas expressed herein are useful to the current debate on how to control this pandemic.*
