<p>Learning from the curve is a voluntary and open source research project on COVID-19 and economics. It is a joint initiative of researchers in economics at <a href="https://ecares.ulb.be/">ECARES</a>, <a href="https://www.solvay.edu/en/">Solvay</a>, <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">ULB</a>. We are economists with expertise in networks, global value chains, industrial organization, health economics, political economy and public and European economics.</p>

<p>We want to provide policy recommendations based on scientific argumentation and data analytics.</p>

The global spread of the COVID-19 virus is intimidating. In the very short run, the rise of the virus disrupts individual health, health care systems, economic systems and social systems. Governments, institutions and doctors have to act very rapidly, taking into account changes in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, capacity of infrastructure, policy decisions etc. At the same time, there is a very large amount of uncertainty: there are reporting lags, there is under-reporting of the number of cases as not everyone is tested, it’s not clear who is infected, we need to account for comorbidity, true mortality rates can only be calculated at the end of the pandemic, etc. However, there is no time to let the uncertainty resolve before taking actions that save lives; actions that in many cases only have an effect in the future, like steering a tanker blindfolded in unknown and unseen waters.

It’s also not clear where we will end up after this devastating crisis. Do we revert back to business as usual, do output levels return to their previous levels or do we see systemic breaks with growth paths to new equilibria?

Together with researchers at the <a href="https://ecares.ulb.be/" target="blank">European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics</a> (<a href="https://www.ulb.be/" target="blank">Université libre de Bruxelles</a>), we want to contribute to help get a grip on the current situation and possible actions. We want to:
</p>

<p>
<span style='font-weight: bold;'>1.</span> present regularly updated numbers on various aspects of the outbreak (disease, economics and social related); relate these to demographics, and micro- and macro economic patterns;
</p>

<p>
<span style='font-weight: bold;'>2.</span> with a focus on health economics, macro economics, political economy and networks;
</p>

<p>
<span style='font-weight: bold;'>3.</span> to understand the possible impact of COVID on the economic tissue of countries, regions and demography.
</p>

<p style='font-style: italic; font-size: small;'>
DISCLAIMER: We are economists with different expertises in networks, welfare, healthcare etc. We are not medical doctors or virologists. Hopefully, we as economists can contribute to thinking about optimal policy decisions, impact on employment and output etc.
