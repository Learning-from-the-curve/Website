<p>Learning from the curve is a voluntary and open source research project on COVID-19 and economics. It is a joint initiative of researchers in economics at <a href="https://ecares.ulb.be/">ECARES</a>, <a href="https://www.solvay.edu/en/">Solvay</a>, <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">ULB</a>. Our mission is:</p>

- to provide detailed and real-time information and visualizations on COVID-19 and economics for the general public and the press,

- to serve as a platform for research collaboration on these topics,

- to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the economic tissue of countries and regions,

- to provide policy recommendations based on scientific arguments supported by data analytics.

<p>
Learning from the curve started as a voluntary effort of faculty and students in empirical economics at ECARES. We are also very grateful for funding from the Special COVID-19 ULB grant. None of this would be possible without either.</p>

<p>We call data from various sources, which are referenced in the respective dashboards and articles. We provide data sources and code on our <a href="https://github.com/Learning-from-the-curve" target="blank">Github</a> organization. All publicly available data, code and visualizations are free to use under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" target="blank">MIT licenses</a>.</p>

If you use any output (data, code or visualizations), please cite www.learningfromthecurve.net and the Learning from the curve team. Contributed articles are copyright protected by the authors.

DISCLAIMER: We are economists with different expertises in networks, welfare, healthcare etc. We are not medical doctors or virologists. Hopefully, we as economists can contribute to thinking about optimal policy decisions, impact on employment and output etc.
