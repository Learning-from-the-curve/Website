#### 1. Introduction

-------------------------------------

The outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, and has been categorized as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. See also [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019–20_coronavirus_pandemic) for more information. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly over almost all countries worldwide.

As of today, there are 777010 total cases, 33572 deaths and 194 countries with reported COVID cases.

This article presents insights in the daily reports on COVID infections worldwide. It analyzes the number of cases and deaths for the most infected countries in the world, the EU, and Belgium respectively. Numbers are always reported in three ways.

- First, we report by calendar date. This provides a snapshot of the current severity of the pandemic across countries.

- Second, we report since the 100th case or death. This allows to compare outbreaks across countries, and generates insights in the different trajectories of those countries.

- Third, we report since the 100th case or death per million inhabitants. This accounts for different sizes of countries and the relative severity by country.

**Note 1:** None of the reported numbers are perfect. For one, not everyone is tested in every country. Specialists estimate the real number of infected people to be 10 or 100 times larger than recorded. Second, some countries have implemented more aggressive testing, while other countries only test those with severe symptoms. This inadvertly raises confirmed cases for the countries that test more extensively. Third, for deaths, there is potential comorbidity, or other factors that might lead to death. It is hard to disentangle the exact cause of death from COVID or comorbidity. Moreover, since not all infected people are tested, infected people that die without being tested are not part of the death counts. In another project, we want to discuss what would be ideal variables to measure the outbreak, and what we can do given the data that is available. Here, we take the numbers, and this observation of data as given.

**Note 2:** Calculations such as the case-fatality rate are extremely noisy if the number of cases is under- or misreported with possibly orders of magnitude difference. We don’t calculate these statistics.

**Note 3:** Analysis will be evolving as the project continues. Any feedback, suggestions, critiques, are highly welcome.
