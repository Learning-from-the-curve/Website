title: Learning from the curve
---
This page contains various blogs and articles on COVID-19 and economics, a joint effort of the [Learning from the curve team](https://learningfromthecurve.net/about/) at [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/), [Solvay](https://www.solvay.edu/en/), [ULB](https://www.ulb.be/).

There are currently three series of articles:

- **Daily updates:** daily insights on COVID-19 numbers with real-time data for Belgium, EU28 and the world, by Federico Gallina and Glenn Magerman at ECARES.
- **Epidemic models:** work-horse epidemic spread models with explanation and estimation for Belgium, by Vincenzo Verardi at UNamur and ULB.
- **Health management:** a series of reflections on COVID-19 and economics, by Jacques Bughin at Solvay and former Mc Kinsey.
- **Articles:** a collection of articles on COVID-19, including less technical, more philosophical and perhaps lighter, tongue-in-cheek writings on COVID-19.

Each series has its own tag, so you can track the different articles of each series.
More series of posts on COVID-19 and economics are added progressively.
We also share data and code on our [Github organization](https://github.com/Learning-from-the-curve).
